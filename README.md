# The P# Project

P sharp is a language developed in python with the reason of me trying new thing. I don't know if this language will keep this name or if it will even be released. There's no release for now. 

This programming language is very similar to lua and is very easy to learn and master. 

For now there is no editor that will be supporting p# once released but I will make my own editor which will have it's own features that will help you code.

Estimated release date: 4/6/2022
