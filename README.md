# The P# Project

P sharp is a language developed in python with the reason of me trying new thing. I don't know if this language will keep this name or if it will even be released. There's no release for now. 

This programming language is very similar to lua and is very easy to learn and master. 

For now there is no editor that will be supporting p# once released but I will make my own editor which will have it's own features that will help you code.

The P# language is based in Python which makes it run extremely fast and it's very reliable. Because of python's capabilities P# also has a lot of stuff that it can do.

Estimated release date: 4/6/2022
